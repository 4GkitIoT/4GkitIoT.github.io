Dear partners,

As our 4GKit is growing up another year (with you and for you) we want to thank you for all the effort you have been making for this experimentation to be a success. In the 4GKit team we think of you so we have not forgotten your Christmas presents :

* Flexible DataSync : Your kit can now be linked to Webcom ([Flexible DataSync API](https://4gkit.orange.com/apis)) allowing you to get notified when changes occur on your 4G connected object, you can also create your own web application to control your objects from Internet ( Thereby solving the famous NAT issue many of you were experiencing).
* New Tutorials for using both [digital](https://4gkit.orange.com/help/tutorials/DHT11/) and [analog](https://4gkit.orange.com/help/tutorials/analog_sensors/) sensors : new eyes and ears for your 4GKit.
* The [file management](https://4gkit.orange.com/file_management) tool become more dynamic : you can edit, download, refresh and remove your files without touching your 4GKit.
* A new, more powerful [console](https://4gkit.orange.com/console) with completion feature to make your interaction with your 4GKit even easier.

To make the best of these new features donâ€™t forget to update your 4GKit or download the newest image.

Merry Christmas and happy new hacking year.

**The 4GKit team**
