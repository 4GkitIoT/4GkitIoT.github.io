Hello dear partners.

Here are the last updates about the experimentation :

1. You can now see the approximative localization of your kit into the Device info when you click onto a specific kit.
Be careful, it shows the localization of the base station currently connected with your kit, so it's not as accurate as GPS.
This information is based on [opencellid.org](http://opencellid.org/). The code we have added only shows your 4G kit location if its associated base station can be found in the opencellid database.
You can find a [new version of the 4G kit code on github](https://github.com/4GkitIoT/Summer-2015-kits)

2. Big thanks to Alexandre from [La Fabrique d'Objets Libres](http://www.fablab-lyon.fr/) (Lyon's FabLab) for his [article](http://anderson69s.com/2015/10/21/4g-kit-by-orange/) and [great 3D casing](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1093431).

3. We have shared various [3D models](http://www.thingiverse.com/pierturk/collections/4gkitiot) (including Alexandre's) on Thingiverse

4. We have completed the First Setup page with [Olimex daughter board schematics](https://github.com/OLIMEX/SOM/tree/master/A13/A13-SOM-LTE) and a [Q&A section](https://4gkit.orange.com/help/Q&A/) to share your first concerns

We are working hard to provide you in the coming weeks with a default VPN connection, cloud APIs and some scripts/tutorials to help you develop your objects faster. If you have any questions, contact us !

Have an excellent day!
